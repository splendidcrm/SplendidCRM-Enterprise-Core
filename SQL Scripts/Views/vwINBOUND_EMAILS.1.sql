-- 01/08/2008 Paul.  Separate out MAILBOX_SSL for ease of coding. Sugar combines it an TLS into the SERVICE field. 
-- 01/13/2008 Paul.  ONLY_SINCE will not be stored in STORED_OPTIONS because we need high-performance access. 
-- 01/13/2008 Paul.  Correct spelling of DELETE_SEEN, which is the reverse of MARK_READ. 
-- 08/01/2010 Paul.  Add CREATED_BY_NAME and MODIFIED_BY_NAME so that we can display the full name in lists like Sugar. 
-- 04/19/2011 Paul.  Add IS_PERSONAL to exclude EmailClient inbound from being included in monitored list. 
-- 01/23/2013 Paul.  Add REPLY_TO_NAME and REPLY_TO_ADDR. 
-- 05/24/2014 Paul.  We need to track the Last Email UID in order to support Only Since flag. 
-- 01/26/2017 Paul.  Add support for Office 365 as an OutboundEmail. 
-- 01/28/2017 Paul.  EXCHANGE_WATERMARK for support of Exchange and Office365.
-- 01/28/2017 Paul.  GROUP_TEAM_ID for inbound emails.
